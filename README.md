# Lid_driven_cavity_CFD_code
Wrote a MATLAB code to implement point Jacobi method and an explicit (point) symmetric Gauss-Seidel scheme on a 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with time derivative preconditioning and an Artificial viscosity term to reach a steady-state solution for MMS and non-MMS cases. Performed code verification by looking at various errors and the order of accuracy.
